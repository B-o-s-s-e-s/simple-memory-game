## Reflection Questions
### 1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
Throughout the pre-work process I consulted W3Schools from the link provided in the documentation and I visited the MDN Web Docs for clarification of JavaScript syntax when I did the optional feature.

### 2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

The overall documentation is really good. It specifically tells us what needs to be implemented along with an explanation. It did not present any challenge in terms of submitting the work.

However, one challenge was making the video for submission. I am not often asked to make a video submission answering interviewing questions. Quite the opposite in fact. All of my interviews have either been in-person or over a live call. It is the medium I am most used to. Given that this time I needed to record my responses, it took a bit longer to get my script to be under the 5 minute limit. After a couple of practice runs, I eventually settled into my comfort zone and I took my interview in one sitting.

Going forward I will plan to make my responses fall under the 5 minutes. It is a good way to make my responses as concrete and as concise as possible.


### 3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

After completing the submission, I have come away interested in why do companies use React.js or Angular to create websites? In this tutorial, we created a website with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Is that enough for a full application with many users?

I have heard that applications often connect to an external database to host data. These database providers like MongoDB have become very popular. My question is how was data managed before the days of MongoDB or MySQL?

My last question is what are the recommended technology stacks that Codepath.org suggests students learn first to get an interview at top tech companies.


### 4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this assignment, I would first find a way to host 
the solution on a production server so that I can see the website in its full glory.

In addition to that, I would add an option for a user to select difficulty because everyone likes a challenge. 

Adding to that perhaps a feature where users can log into an account and post a record of their fastest times on a public leaderboard. 

It can even be extended to include multiplayer functionality.

Incorporating these new features requires designing a system to support processes. Refactoring code to make it more manageable and even making modules out of existing functionalities is a way to abstract the app making process.
